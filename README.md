# NBA Player Stats Web Scraper

This is a simple web scraper using Streamlit. We use the [basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) website to scrape HTML tables and use the Streamlit Library to deploy this app.

Streamlit is an easy way to quickly build data science apps and share it without having to code extensively.
